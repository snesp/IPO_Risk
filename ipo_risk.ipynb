    "**Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook reports the analysis of past IPOs (from the year 2000 to 2020) in order to assess the risk of an IPO investment. Risk is a measure of uncertainity, and hence, in the context of an IPO investment there are 2 types of risks- Upside risk (which results in profits) and Downside risk (which results in losses). Any potential investor would want understand the factors that influence both these types of risks so that they can maximize their returns and refrain from making losses in this kind of an investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in this analysis we would address the following points that would help a potential investor make data-driven decisions about choosing an IPO:\n",
    "1. Measure the risk of investment in an IPO\n",
    "2. Stratergies to minimize the downside risk in IPO investment\n",
    "3. Factors that influence the rewards (i.e. the upside risk) of an IPO\n",
    "4. Predict the returns of an IPO\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses only the first day performance of the IPO to assess the risk as well as returns. The current market price has been conciously avoided as it is the heavily depended on the market cycle and multiple exogeneous factors which are over-riding and outside the scope of this study."

    "Information about the social trends around the time of IPO has been fetched from google trends api. We obtain the search volume for a company (keyword=name of the company) all over the world, one month before the IPO launch date, in order to gauge the popularity for the company's stocks in the market. \n",

Hence, we filter companies by their launch date, and search for the relative search volume for all these companies before their launch (to show how popular one IPO was in relation to another launching on the same day). \n",
